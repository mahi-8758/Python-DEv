# 🧩Python - Blackjack Game 

A classic command-line Blackjack (21) game built with Python. This project features a fully playable, text-based game against an automated dealer, using `colorama` for a more engaging and colorful console experience.





##  🛠️Features

* **Classic Rules:** Play against the dealer to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
* **Hit or Stand:** Choose to "Hit" (take another card) or "Stand" (keep your current hand).
* **Automatic Scoring:** The game automatically calculates hand values, including handling Aces as 1 or 11.
* **Dealer Logic:** The dealer follows standard rules (must hit until 17 or higher).
* **Visual Flair:** Uses `colorama` for colored text (e.g., green for wins, red for losses) and `art.py` for ASCII art to enhance the display.

##  🛠️Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3
* **Standard Libraries:** `random` (for card shuffling), `time` (for dramatic pauses)
* **External Libraries:** `colorama` (for adding color to the terminal output)
* **Local Modules:** `art.py` (for custom ASCII art)

## 🚀Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mahi-8758/Python-DEv.git
    cd Python-DEv
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    The only external library is `colorama`. You can install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install colorama
    ```

## 🎮How to Play

To run the complete game (which uses functions and all rules), navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
python capstonedef.py
```
