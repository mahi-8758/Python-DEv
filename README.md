# My Python Learning Journey 🐍

Welcome to my repository! This is where I'm documenting my journey of learning Python from the ground up. This space serves as a living portfolio of the small projects, exercises, and concepts I'm tackling.

## 🌱 About This Repository

I believe the best way to learn is by doing. This repository is my commitment to that philosophy. You'll find a collection of simple scripts and basic projects, each one built to help me understand a new concept in Python.

My goal is to go from the fundamentals to more advanced topics, one project at a time.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3
* **Core Libraries:** [**.'random`, `os`, `json`**]

## 🏃 How to Run These Projects

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/mahi-8758/Python-DEv.git]
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project folder:**
    ```bash
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME
    ```
3.  **Run the Python script:**
    ```bash
    python script_name.py
    ```

## 🎯 What's Next?

My next learning goals are:
* [** "Understanding Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)"**]
* [** "Learning to fetch data from an API"**]
* [** "Building a simple app with a GUI (like Tkinter)"**]
